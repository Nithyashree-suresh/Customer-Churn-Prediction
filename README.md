# Customer-Churn-Prediction

This repository contains a detailed analysis of a bank customer dataset from Kaggle to predict customer churn at a particular Bank. The project focuses on exploring various factors contributing to churn and developing predictive models using classification algorithms. Here I have also applied GridSearchCV to find the best hyperparameters for the models.

Project Overview:

Using a dataset with features such as credit score, geography, gender, age, tenure, balance, number of products, credit card ownership, and estimated salary, we aim to predict customer churn (whether a customer has exited). The repository demonstrates a complete data science workflow, including exploratory data analysis and model training and evaluation.

Key Components:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing and examining key relationships and patterns in the data, providing insights into factors that may influence churn.
Model Development: Training and evaluating various machine learning models to predict customer churn, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest.

Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics such as confusion matrix, precision, recall, ROC AUC. Comparing the results of different models to identify the best approach for churn prediction.

Results:

The analysis revealed key insights into factors that impact churn, with the Random Forest model providing the best overall performance. The project concludes with recommendations for implementing churn prediction in a business context and suggests possible next steps for further refinement and improvement.
